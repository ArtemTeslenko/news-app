## General Information

- Welcome to my news page project!

- This project was created with a focus on providing a high-quality user experience with a valid, cross-browser, and semantic layout. It is adaptive and pixel-perfect, ensuring that it looks great on any screen width.

- To achieve this, I used Vue.js, SCSS, and BEM. These technologies helped me to create a flexible and maintainable codebase, making it easier to update and improve the project in the future.

- I am proud of the result of this project, and I hope you enjoy exploring the site. Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions on how to improve it further.
